# Nussknacker Quickstart

This is a part of Nussknacker's [quickstart](https://nussknacker.io/quickstart/docker).
On this page you can find information about how to start work with Nussknacker designer tool.
If you want to start your own project using Nussknacker, just fork this repo, change `./conf/nusskacker/nussknacker.conf`,
register own schemas (similar to those available at `./testData/schema`) and start designing own scenarios!

```bash
./start.sh
```
